# srclib

srclib (pronounced source library) is a free script tag to add to your website to add a "View Source" button always visible on screen. I use it for use in projects where my teacher must see the source code of a webpage easily.

install on webpage:
add the following script tag to the <head> section.
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sssynk/srclib/srclib.js"></script>
 ```

direct CDN link
 ```
  - (preferred) https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sssynk/srclib/srclib.js
```
